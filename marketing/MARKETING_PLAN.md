Subject: SaneBar - Privacy-focused menu bar manager for macOS

Hi Michael,

I built SaneBar, a Mac menu bar manager that declutters your menu bar
while keeping everything accessible — with optional Touch ID protection.

Quick facts:
- Hides/shows menu bar icons with a click or keyboard shortcut
- 100% on-device, no analytics, no cloud
- Works on macOS Tahoe (15.0+) while competitors break
- $5 one-time purchase (open source on GitHub)

SaneBar emerged as a privacy-focused alternative after the Bartender
acquisition raised trust concerns in 2024. Would love to share more
for Indie App Spotlight.

— Mr. Sane

### 3. Directory Submissions (All Free)
- [ ] **AlternativeTo** — List as alternative to Bartender, Hidden Bar, Ice
- [ ] **MacUpdate** — 30,000+ apps directory
- [ ] **Softpedia Mac** — "100% Clean" certification available

### 4. Reddit Prep (Start Now)
- **Target**: r/macapps (172K members, self-promo allowed)
- **Rule**: Build 100+ karma first, then post
- **Frame as**: "I built X because Y annoyed me" not "check out my app"

## Phase 2: Launch Week

### Product Hunt Launch

**Timing**: Weekend (Saturday/Sunday)
- Only 366 upvotes needed for #1 on weekends vs 633 on Monday

- [ ] Create teaser page 1 week before
- [ ] Prepare tagline (60 chars): "SaneBar – Declutter your Mac menu bar in seconds"
- [ ] Gallery: 2-4 images showing before/after of cluttered vs clean menu bar
- [ ] First comment ready (300-400 words with backstory)
- [ ] Launch at 12:01 AM Pacific exactly

**Expected Results**:
- 500-2,500 unique visitors
- 1-3% conversion to purchase
- Valuable SEO backlink (PH domain rating: 91)

### Hacker News "Show HN"

**Title**: "Show HN: SaneBar – A privacy-focused menu bar manager for macOS"

**First Comment Template**:
```
Hey HN, I'm the creator. Built this because Bartender got acquired
and I didn't trust the new owners with my menu bar data.

SaneBar is:
- 100% on-device (no analytics, no cloud)
- Open source on GitHub
- Works on macOS Tahoe while others break

Looking for feedback on the UX — especially the "Find Icon" search
feature. What would make this more useful for your workflow?

GitHub: [link]
```

**Timing**: Monday-Wednesday, 9 AM Pacific

### Reddit r/macapps Post

**Title Ideas**:
- "I built a Bartender alternative after the acquisition sketched me out"
- "After Bartender got acquired, I made my own menu bar manager"

**Key**: Answer EVERY comment. Fixing bugs mentioned in comments in real-time drives engagement.
